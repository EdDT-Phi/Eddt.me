Massively multiplayer online action game in javascript which uses sockets to update clients in real time. Uses express for routing and server functions.

## To run
=> npm start

## To use locally
Run and point browser to 'localhost:3000'

## To use in production
Set environment variable PORT=80 and run

## To modify
The client code is in public/game/js/
The server code is in server/

For now all the code is in one file, which makes it kinda unreadable so  next steps include seperating server and client code into modules.
